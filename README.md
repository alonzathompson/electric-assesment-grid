# electric-assesment-grid

This is an assesment of basic electrical grid components. It is meant to aid those who are 
looking to test their knowledge on the basics of the electrical grid system.This is the first commit,
the quiz done with a basic server and vanilla js before refactoring.This was to explore more of javascript and css
without frameworks to get a better grasp on what the frameworks are actually manipulating.

next steps are to modularize the js file, write test
